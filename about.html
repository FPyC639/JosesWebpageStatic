        Currently I am pursuing a degree in Masters of Science Degree in Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
        Roles that I am currently working at involve a few such as being a Software Engineering Intern at Panasonic Corporation
        of North America, a supervisor at Krispy Kreme as well as other freelance roles. Some freelance roles that I work as include
        following AI consultant at Outlier AI, Private Tutor and Varsity Tutor, and working as Technology Blogger. I have done work 
        as undergraduate researcher in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers such as Facebook's DETR (Detection Transformer).
        Additionally, I have worked on projects that include the following Video and Deep Learning, and Recurrent Neural Networks as well as 
        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) using the TensorFlow Framework in Python. Some of my previous roles include
        working as a Teaching Assistant for AI4ALL and for Kean University. Activities I am fond of include the following making videos for students
        learning materials.
